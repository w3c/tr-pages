  <h2>W3C Community Group Report or W3C Business Group Report</h2>

  <p>A W3C Community or Business Group Report is a document produced by a W3C
    Community or Business Group.</p>

  <p>These reports follow the W3C Community and Business Group Process, designed to allow an easy way for
    innovation by individuals, outside the formal W3C standards process. These reports have not received
    formal review and are not endorsed by W3C.</p>

  <p>These reports MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards. They may or may not be brought to the W3C standardization track.

  <p>Software MAY implement these reports at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
    nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on the document.</p>

  <p>These reports may be in Draft or Final form:
  <ul>
    <li>A Draft Report received patent licensing commitments from the participants for their contributions under the W3C Community
      Licensing Agreement.</li>
    <li>A Final Report receiving patent licensing commitments for the entire specification from the organizations who committed
  to the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.</li>
  </ul>


   <p>A W3C Community or Business Group report MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.
  </section>
  <section id='SUBM'>
  <h2>W3C Member Submission</h2>
  <span id='Member-SUBM'></span>

  <p>A W3C Member Submission is a document produced by one or more W3C Members.</p>

  <p>A submission is a document allowing W3C Members to propose technology or other ideas for consideration.
    These submissions have not received formal review and are not endorsed W3C.</p>

  <p>These submissions MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and may or may not become W3C standards.

  <p>Software MAY implement these reports at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
      nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.</p>

  <p>The Member Submission process affords W3C Members a record of their contribution and gives them
    a mechanism for disclosures (including IPR claims).

    <p>A Member Submission MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.

  <section id='ED'>
    <h2>Editor's draft</h2>
    <span id='editor-draft-finding'></span>

    <p>An Editor's draft is a document produced by a W3C Group.</p>

    <p>An editor's draft is a document allowing the Group to iterate internally on its content for consideration.
      Editor's Drafts are works in progress inside a W3C Group and are not required to have the consensus of the Group participants.
      These drafts have not received formal review and are not endorsed W3C.</p>

    <p>These drafts MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and may or may not become W3C standards.

    <p>Software MAY implement these drafts at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
        nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.</p>

    <p>There are no patent protection covering the implementations of editor's drafts.</p>

    <p>An Editor's Draft is a document that W3C has not yet published and the group responsible for the draft may publish eventually.</p>

   <h2>Recommendation</h2>

   <p>A W3C Recommendation is a specification or set of guidelines or requirements that, after extensive consensus-building,

    <p>W3C recommends the wide deployment of a Recommendation as a standard for the Web.
      These documents MAY be cited as W3C standards.
    <p>
    Some W3C Recommendation MAY be continuously revised while others are maintained by creating a new version. Upcoming changes
    are listed as candidate and proposed amendments in W3C Recommendations. Feedback on those amendments is encouraged.


   <p>Software SHOULD implement these specifications.

    <p>A W3C Recommendation has commitments from Working Group members to

  <section id='amendedrec'>
   <h2>Amended Recommendation</h2>

   <p>An Amended Recommendation is a specification that updates a previous Recommendation to include substantive changes that do not add new features. An Amended Recommendation is produced by the W3C Staff to update a Recommendation (e.g. to incorporate errata) when no W3C Working Group has a charter with a scope that covers the content of the Recommendation.
