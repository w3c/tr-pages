  <h2>W3C Community Group Report or W3C Business Group Report</h2>

  <p>A W3C Community or Business Group Report is a document produced by a W3C
    Community or Business Group.</p>

  <p>These reports follow the W3C Community and Business Group Process, designed to allow an easy way for
    innovation by individuals, outside the formal W3C standards process. These reports have not received
    formal review and are not endorsed by W3C.</p>

  <p>These reports MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and MAY never be brought to the W3C standardization track.

  <p>Software MAY implement these reports at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
    nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on the document.</p>

  <p>These reports may be in Draft or Final form:
  <ul>
    <li>A Draft Report received patent licensing commitments from the participants for their contributions under the W3C Community
      Licensing Agreement.</li>
    <li>A Final Report receiving patent licensing commitments for the entire specification from the organizations who committed
  to the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.</li>
  </ul>


   <p>A W3C Community or Business Group report MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.
  </section>
  <section id='SUBM'>
  <h2>W3C Member Submission</h2>
  <span id='Member-SUBM'></span>

  <p>A W3C Member Submission is a document produced by one or more W3C Members.</p>

  <p>A submission is a document allowing W3C Members to propose technology or other ideas for consideration.
    These submissions have not received formal review and are not endorsed W3C.</p>

  <p>These submissions MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and MAY never become W3C standards.

  <p>Software MAY implement these reports at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
      nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.</p>

  <p>The Member Submission process affords W3C Members a record of their contribution and gives them
    a mechanism for disclosures (including IPR claims).

    <p>A Member Submission MAY get picked up by a standards organization, including W3C, to incorporate into a future Standard.

    <h2>Editor's draft</h2>
    <span id='editor-draft-finding'></span>

    <p>An editor's draft is a document allowing the Group to iterate internally on its content for consideration.
      Editor's Drafts are works in progress inside a W3C Group and are not required to have the consensus of the Group participants.
      These drafts have not received formal review and are not endorsed W3C.</p>

    <p>These drafts MUST NOT be cited as W3C standards and MAY never become W3C standards.

    <p>Software MAY implement these drafts at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged
        nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.</p>

    <p>There are no patent protection covering the implementations of editor's drafts.</p>
