<p>The classes of specifications listed in this section have not received formal review by <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Members, by software developers, and by other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> groups and interested parties. These specifications are not endorsed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Director and do not imply endorsement by <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Members.

</p><p>Specifications in this class <em class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em> be cited as <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards and <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> never become <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards.

</p><p>Software <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> implement these specifications at their own risk.  Implementation is neither discouraged nor encouraged but can contribute to proposals for further action on a specification.

It may be in Draft or Final form. When such a group announces a Final Report that is a Specification, the group asks participants to make patent licensing commitments for their contributions under the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Community Final Specification Agreement.
   Group reports follow the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Community and Business Group Process, designed to allow an easy way for innovation by individuals, outside the formal <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards process.

<p>A Working Draft is a document that <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> has published for review and for simple historical reference. A Working Draft is a work in progress and the content is not required to have full consensus of the Group participants, though the Group must have consensus to publish the draft.

<p>A Candidate Recommendation is a document that satisfies the technical requirements established in the Group charter or in subsequent requirements documents, has consensus of the Group participants, has gotten public review, and has received formal review from other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Groups. A Candidate Recommendation may be in Draft or Snapshot form. Such specification is intended to gather final feedback from implementers.

<section id="retired">
  <h2 id="x4-retired"><bdi class="secno">4. </bdi>Retired Documents<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#retired"></a></h2>
  <p>Some documents may additionally be annotated as "retired".  This
  annotation is most commonly added to Notes about work that is no
  longer being actively pursued. The Status section of such documents
  may contain information on the state of the work at the time the
  work ceased.  A document marked as "retired" will not be listed in
  W3C's default index of Technical Reports.  A retired document
  otherwise retains the formal status of its document class.</p>
